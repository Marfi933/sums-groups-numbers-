A set of numbers is a file that has one integer on each line.
A set of number groups is a file where there is one or more numbers with any number of spaces on each line.
Write a function that creates a set of sums of individual groups for a group file.
It is not possible to load the entire file into memory, perform the calculation and save the result to a file. You must process the file line by line.
You will find your function in the program that first asks the user for the source and then for the destination file. The program then calls your function, announces the success to the users and terminates. If the program fails, it informs the user as much as possible about the error and terminates.
The program must also deal with situations where the input file is in the wrong format.
The program must not end with an error - an interpreter error dump.
